3. On the next screen, you will enter a credit card.  There should not be charges for normal usage for the class.  If you have signed up before, there may be a charge for around $3.50 per month.  Since we dont have a book for this class, consider this to be the cost of the book you would have purchased.

4. Congratulations!  You have now set up your account and can access an incredible number of cloud services.  Once you understand how to use an Amazon cloud server, you will be able to use other cloud providers (like Google) if you want to investigate them in the future.
