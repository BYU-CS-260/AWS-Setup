# S3-AWS
Now that you can see the files that your docker web server is serving in your web browser, you want other people throughout the world (like your Mom) to be able to see them too.  In order to do this, we will be using a cloud based web server to serve your files.  

Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a cloud based web server through their [S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Welcome.html).  
In this learning activity, you will set up your Amazon AWS account and then will create a S3 bucket to serve your web pages.  We will show you how to manage your own web server later in the class.
1. In your browser, select the [AWS login page](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/) and select “Create a new AWS account”.
